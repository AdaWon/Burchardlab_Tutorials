# Burchardlab_Tutorials

I have set up this repository as a catch-all for the notes I make as I learn new programs and design pipelines. My Tutorials will focus on the codes I have used successfully with notes about what needed troubleshooting. I have attempted to make these walkthorughs clear and accurate with helpful details not included in the available vignettes.

- **Markdown** - quick summary of markdown syntax used to create the following files
- **ADMIXTURE** - used to estimate global genetic ancestry; walkthrough of a supervised admixed run on African Americans
- **GENESES_PCRelate** - used to estimate relatedness measurements in sample; genetic relatedness matrix generation
